# ASXL1_analysis

The repository documents the analysis done to identify differential DNA methylation signature associated with combined immunodeficiency, characterized with rubella granuloma, in a patient with ASXL1 missense variants.
There are several Rmd files containing different phases of the analyses, notably, 02-TurveyBiggs_Report_20190705.html is a fully knitted analysis script, with detailed documentation of each preprocessing and analysis step. 
The 08-ASXL1_Redo_all_preprocessing_and_analysis.Rmd and 09-ASXL1_Tcell_and_Rescue.Rmd outlined the final analysis pipeline for bulk tissue (whole blood, PBMC, and buccal swab) and cultured T cells, published on Journal of Experimental Medicine (doi: 10.1084/jem.20240945)
